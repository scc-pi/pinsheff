# R & RStudio {#r}

## Style guide

Something I need to pay more attention to is following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), which benefits from supporting tools and familiarity via tidyverse package documentation.

Scripting to the same style guide makes collaboration easier. Which style guide is less important than collaborators scripting to the same style guide.

## RStudio security & data protection {#pid}

### Workspace {#workspace}

To encourage reproducible R scripts, Hadley Wickham recommends not preserving your workspace between sessions. This entails deselecting a couple of options to save and restore [.Rdata](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/rdata-files.html) (see [chapter 8 Workflow: projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#what-is-real) in Hadley's R4DS book).

Hadley's recommendation also reduces the chances of inadvertently sharing PID in a GitHub repository. However, `.Rdata` should also be included in the [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file and the repository set to private (see the section on [GitHub security & data protection](#github-security)).

### Passwords

It's poor practice to include login details in code. I use the `.Renviron` file option for [securing credentials](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/#use-environment-variables). However, if you're sharing the script you can anticipate that the environment variable might not be set and use the RStudio API to prompt for credentials. For example:

```{r credentials, eval=FALSE}
portal_pwd <- Sys.getenv("portal_pwd")
if(length(portal_pwd) == 0){
  portal_pwd <- rstudioapi::askForPassword("Portal password")
}
```

## Getting started with R

I'm not going to provide advice on getting started, other than signposting to the excellent resources listed on the RStudio beginners page:

[RStudio Education - Beginners](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)

Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) is the main book people use when new to R. However, if you already have some coding experience [A Succinct Intro to R](http://r-guide.steveharoz.com/index.html) by Steve Haroz is useful.

## RStudio tips

### Code display

A few non-default Global Options, under Code and Display, make it a little easier to read and write code:

-   Show margin (aim to limit a line of code to 80 characters)

-   Highlight R function calls

-   Rainbow parentheses (since RStudio v1.4)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/code-display.png")
```

### Document outline & headings

Code sections and subsections are useful:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Prefix a section with a hash tag and suffix with 4 or more dashes ----
## Subsections have additional hash tags ----
```

The sections can be collapsed and are also listed in the document outline pane:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/doc-outline.png")
```

### ViewPipeSteps addin

The [pipe](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) `%>%` is useful for reading and writing code, but can make debugging cumbersome. The `ViewPipeSteps` addin lets you view the output of your pipe chain after each step. To install:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("daranzolin/ViewPipeSteps")
library(ViewPipeSteps)
```

To use:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/view-pipe-steps.png")
```

### Shortcuts

RStudio has lots of shortcuts. What you find most useful is down to preference and the areas of the IDE you use most often. These are the shortcuts I've found most useful:

|                          |                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Ctrl + Enter             | run selected lines      |
| Ctrl + Alt + P           | re-run previous         |
| Ctrl + Shift + C         | comment/uncomment lines |
| Ctrl + Alt + A           | reformat code           |
| Ctrl + Shift + R         | insert section          |
| Alt + -                  | assignment operator \<- |
| Ctrl + Shift + M         | pipe operator %\>%      |
| Ctrl + left mouse button | View the object clicked |
| Ctrl + Shift + F10       | Restart R session       |
| Ctrl + Shift + P         | Command palette         |
