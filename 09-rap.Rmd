# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines {#rap}

## Principles

RAPs have evolved from the UK Govenment's Analysis Function and their 2022 [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/) sets out the following principles.

Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs) are automated statistical and analytical processes. They incorporate elements of software engineering best practice to ensure that the pipelines are reproducible, auditable, efficient, and high quality.  

RAPs increase the efficiency of statistical and analytical processes, delivering value. Reproducibility and auditability increase trust in the statistics. The pipelines are easier to quality assure than manual processes, leading to higher quality.

A RAP will:

* improve the quality of the analysis  

* increase trust in the analysis by producers, their managers and users  

* create a more efficient process  

* improve business continuity and knowledge management  

To achieve these benefits, at a minimum a RAP must:

* minimise manual steps, for example copy-paste, point-click, or drag-drop operation; where it is necessary to include a manual step in the process this must be documented as described in the following bullet points  

* be built using open-source software, which is available to anyone, preferably R or Python  

* deepen technical and quality assurance processes with peer review to ensure that the process is reproducible and that the requirements described in the following bullet points have been met  

* guarantee an audit trail using version control software, preferably Git
be open to anyone – this can be allowed most easily using file and code sharing platforms  

* follow existing good practice for quality assurance  

* contain well-commented code and have documentation embedded and version controlled within the product, rather than saved elsewhere

Notes:

1. There may be restrictions, such as access to databases, which stop analysis producers building a RAP for their full end-to-end process. In this case, the previously described requirements apply to the selected part of the process.  

1. There may be restrictions, such as sensitive or confidential content, which stop analysis producers from sharing their RAP publicly. In this case, it may be possible to share the RAP within a department or organisation instead.  

1. It is recommended that where possible a RAP should be built collaboratively – this will improve the quality of the final product and helps to allow knowledge sharing.  

There is no specific tool that is required to build a RAP, but both R and Python provide the power and flexibility to carry out end-to-end analytical processes, from data source to final presentation.

Once the minimum RAP has been implemented, statisticians and analysts should attempt to further develop their pipeline using:

* functions or code modularity  

* unit testing of functions  

* error handling for functions  

* documentation of functions  

* packaging  

* code style  

* input data validation  

* logging of data and the analysis  

* continuous integration  

* dependency management  

## Strategy Goals  

The Government's RAP strategy includes three goals:  

1. **tools** – ensure that analysts have the tools they need to implement RAP principles.  

1. **capability** – give analysts the guidance, support and learning to be confident implementing the RAPs.  

1. **culture** – create a culture of robust analysis where the RAP principles are the default for analysis, leaders engage with managing analysis as software, and users of analysis understand why this is important.


## Platforms for Reproducible Analysis

The lists below are from the Government's RAP strategy and include notes on current SCC status.  

### For RAPs that meet the minimum criteria  

1. version control software, that is, git - *BI Team laptops*  

1. open-source programming languages and flexibility to add more (Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, C++, Java/Scala etc.) - *BI Team laptops & OSCAR desktop*  

1. package and environment managers for each of the available languages - *don't have*

1. packages and libraries for open-source programming languages, either through direct access to well-known libraries, for example, npm, PyPI, CRAN, or through a proxy repository system, for example, Artifactory   - *BI Team laptops & OSCAR desktop*

1. individual storage, for example, home directory  - *OneDrive - Sheffield City Council* 

1. shared storage, for example, s3, cloud storage, with fine-grained access control, accessible programmatically  - *don't have*  

1. integrated development environments suitable for the available languages – RStudio for R, Visual Studio Code for Python and so on - *BI Team laptops & OSCAR desktop*  

### For further development of RAPs  

1. source control platforms, for example, GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket - *trialing GitHub organisation [github.com/scc-pi](github.com/scc-pi)*  

1. continuous integration tools, for example, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, Jenkins, Concourse - *trialing GitHub Actions*  

1. make-like tools for reproducible workflows, for example, make - *identified [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) r package but not yet tested it*  

1. relational database management software, for example, PostgreSQL, that is available to users - *corporate solution being investigated and currently there's limited DBMS access available via OSCAR desktop*  

1. orchestration systems for pipelines and workflows, for example, airflow, NiFi - *don't have*  

1. internal-facing servers to host html-rendered documentation - *requested by refused*  

1. external-facing servers with authentication to host end-products such as web applications or APIs - *don't have*    

1. big data tool, for example, Presto or Athena, Spark, dask and so on, or access to large memory capability - *don't have*    

1. reproducible infrastructure and containers, for example, docker *docker on BI Team laptops but not tested yet*   

## MLOPs

Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) is more specifically about automating the building and deployment of models. RAPs covers a broader range of data analysis output.
