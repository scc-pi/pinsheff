# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines {#rap}

> Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs) are automated statistical and analytical processes. They incorporate elements of software engineering best practice to ensure that the pipelines are reproducible, auditable, efficient, and high quality.  

## Government Strategy  

RAPs have evolved from the UK Govenment's Analysis Function. Their 2022 [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/) includes three goals:  

1. **tools** – ensure that analysts have the tools they need to implement RAP principles.  

1. **capability** – give analysts the guidance, support and learning to be confident implementing the RAPs.  

1. **culture** – create a culture of robust analysis where the RAP principles are the default for analysis, leaders engage with managing analysis as software, and users of analysis understand why this is important.


## Platforms for Reproducible Analysis

The lists below are from the Government's RAP strategy and include notes on current SCC status.  

### For RAPs that meet the minimum criteria  

version control software, that is, git  
open-source programming languages and flexibility to add more – Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, C++, Java/Scala and so on  
package and environment managers for each of the available languages  
packages and libraries for open-source programming languages, either through direct access to well-known libraries, for example, npm, PyPI, CRAN, or through a proxy repository system, for example, Artifactory  
individual storage, for example, home directory  
shared storage, for example, s3, cloud storage, with fine-grained access control, accessible programmatically  
integrated development environments suitable for the available languages – RStudio for R, Visual Studio Code for Python and so on  

### For further development of RAPs  

source control platforms, for example, GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket  
continuous integration tools, for example, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, Jenkins, Concourse  
make-like tools for reproducible workflows, for example, make  
relational database management software, for example, PostgreSQL, that is available to users  
orchestration systems for pipelines and workflows, for example, airflow, NiFi  
internal-facing servers to host html-rendered documentation  
external-facing servers with authentication to host end-products such as web applications or APIs  
big data tool, for example, Presto or Athena, Spark, dask and so on, or access to large memory capability  
reproducible infrastructure and containers, for example, docker  

## MLOPs

Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) is more specifically about automating the building and deployment of models. RAPs covers a broader range of data analysis outputs.
