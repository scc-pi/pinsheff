# Version Control & GitHub {#github}

You don't have to be familiar with version control, Git and GitHub to make use of these notes or the contents of the [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) repositories. If you're new to scripting and R, then visualisations or using R Markdown are better starting points than version control.

These notes are public, but to contribute i.e. [edit them](https://github.com/scc-pi/notes), you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and to be granted permission by an owner of [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) (try Laurie first, but Giles and Anne could help too). Then you can edit directly in GitHub via your browser.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/github-edit.png")
```

You also need a GitHub account and permission to access one of our private repositories, but not for our public repositories, to download a file, copy & paste code, or source and use a function:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load functions from a public scc-pi repository 
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scc-pi/functions/main/Examples.R")

# Call one of our Sheffield area functions that returns LSOA codes 
shef_lsoa_codes() %>% 
  head(5) %>% #only display the first 5 records
  knitr::kable() #display them in a nice table 
```

Try raising an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) if you spot a problem, have a suggestion or a question.

## Why version control?

When scripting you might make a backup copy of a file, so if your new changes break what was previously working you can revert to the backup copy. If you're collating contributions to a document from different people you might use their initials in the file names to indicate and keep track of who's made contributions in what version e.g. "BI_Principles-GR.docx" and "BI_Principles-NM.docx". These are both examples of manual version control.

When we talk about version control and scripting we typically mean a version control system. A tool that assists with tracking changes to files over time and by different people. Such systems also usually include reasons for the changes, and file, or rather version, comparison functionality. So a version control system is a backup/audit trail/collaboration thing.

## GIT

Git is an open-source distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## GitHub

GitHub is a product that offers Git-based source control repositories. Other products also offer Git-based repositories, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps.

Our [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) GitHub organisation is a free account. It has had no approval as such. If using it proves successful we will need to discuss approval with BCIS.

### GitHub security & data protection {#github-security}

Assuming that GitHub.com is hosted in the US, it will not meet our data protection obligations. Either way, we've not checked compliance with Information Governance, so storing PID (Person Identifiable Data), or anything commercially confidential or politically sensitive, on GitHub.com is currently a no-no.

The [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file lists the folders and files you want to exclude from the repository i.e. it specifies what you want to ignore. Holding any file based data (e.g. CSV files), whether they're original or transformed, in a `/data` sub-folder, makes it simple to exclude data from the repository by adding the following to the `.gitignore` file:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# data directory
/data/
```

As an additional precaution, any projects involving confidential information should be held in a private repository and [`.Rdata`](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/rdata-files.html) should also be included in the `.gitignore` file (see the section on [RStudio security & data protection](#pid)):

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Session Data files
.RData
```

Microsoft own GitHub and [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/github.githubenterprise?tab=overview) is the on-premises deployment of GitHub.com that could be hosted on our own Azure environment.

### Forking & pull requests

GitHub [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and pull requests are common workflows when collaborating on a repository.

*- we'll have more to add on this if we collaborate on a repository*

### Other features

GitHub now allows private repositories on [free organisation accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts), but not all GitHub features are available.

The evolution of a repository is captured by commits i.e. the changes to files in the repository. However, the original issue, ideas or discussion surrounding a commit is captured in a GitHub [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can link a commit to an issue by including the issue number prefixed by \# in the commit message.

I've used a GitHub [project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) to organise our private [C19Surveillance](https://github.com/scc-pi/C19Surveillance) repository as a kanban board. However, a project is not restricted to issues or a single repository.

GitHub [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) have been used to [publish these notes](#publishing).

There are also other GitHub features to explore.

## Git & RStudio

[Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) on the GitHub [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) is a good place to get started and become familiar with some initial concepts and the GitHub website.

To use GitHub with RStudio there's a thorough step-by-step guide, [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan. My main recommendation is to setup the connection using [keys for SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html). This connection method by-passes the issues I've had with the Council's proxy server and using the HTTPS connection method. I've also had no issues since working from home and connecting via the Tunnel. UPDATE: [GitHub token authentication required](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/) since August 2021.

I frequently return to Jenny Bryan's book, especially for chapters 15, 16 and 17 on different ways of setting up a local RStudio project connected to GitHub. So far, I've mainly stuck with [Chapter 15 New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html).
