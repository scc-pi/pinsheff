## Row context  

DAX is not vectorised like R, nor does it have the concept of a "current row" that you might be familiar with from using VBA or a cursor in procedural or transact SQL. The article [Row context in DAX](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/row-context-in-dax/) by Marco Russo & Alberto Ferrari (28/03/22) explains this well.
