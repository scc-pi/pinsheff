# (PART) Scripting {.unnumbered}

# Why script? 

I initially started scripting in Python to automate some spatial analysis tasks, but found reproducibility the main advantage. Iterating, improving a process incrementally and at the end verifying the results by re-running the script.

There's an element of self-documentation with scripting, so it's easier to return to a scripted task after a bit of time away from it, or pick up a scripted task from a colleague. However, in-line comments and adherence to a style guide make a big difference to just how easy it is. Version control and collaboration are also easier with scripting than GUI tools.

Scripting is not always better than using GUI tools. There's a good reason that more people use Mac OS and Windows than Unix Bash. Scripting or GUI tools is a horses for courses question, and some GUI workflow tools (e.g. FME, Simul8 and ModelBuilder in ArcGIS) sit somewhere in the middle.
