# Why script?

## What is scripting? 

Scripts are a series of typed commands in a file. When you "run" a script, you are asking a programme to interpret and fulfil the commands in the script to accomplish a given task. 

The terms "scripting", "coding" and "programming" are often used synonymously. However, coding and programming are synonymous and are umbrella terms. Whereas scripting is just a part of these umbrella terms. Compared with coding and programming, scripting generally covers less complex tasks, with an easier to understand language, and with fewer commands.

## Scripting for data analysis 

Scripts can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks. For example, BCIS in Sheffield City Council use scripts to update and maintain laptops and servers.  

For the purposes of these notes, we are limiting the scope of scripting to mean scripting for data analysis. So, scripting to accomplish data analysis tasks, including data:  

* extraction  

* transformation  

* loading  

* exploration  

* analysis  

* modelling 

* visualisation  

* narration  

Scripting for data capture, data entry, is outside the scope of these notes.

## Scripting pros & cons? 

There's an element of self-documentation with scripting, so it's easier to return to a scripted task after a bit of time away from it, or pick up a scripted task from a colleague. However, in-line comments and adherence to a style guide make a big difference to just how easy it is. Version control and collaboration are also easier with scripting than GUI tools.

Scripting is not always better than using GUI tools. There's a good reason that more people use Mac OS and Windows than Unix Bash. Scripting or GUI tools is a horses for courses question, and some GUI workflow tools that the Council has licenses for (e.g. FME, Simul8 and ModelBuilder in ArcGIS) sit somewhere in the middle.

RStudio makes the (slightly biased?) case for scripting in an hour long webinar on [Why Your Enterprise Needs Code-First Data Science](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/why-your-enterprise-needs-code-first-data-science/)

## Who writes scripts?  

### Laurie Platt, BI Team   

Laurie used to develop software before working as a Town Planner. His experience with coding rather than Excel meant scripting was a more obvious tool for him. Laurie initially started scripting whilst a Planner, using Python to **automate** some spatial analysis tasks. However, he found **reproducibility** to be the main advantage of scripting. Iterating, improving a process incrementally and at the end verifying the results by re-running the script.
