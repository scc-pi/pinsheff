## Office of National Statistics

For this example we're going to get the population for each Ward in Sheffield. First we need to [find the dataset on the ONS website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland). From which we copy the link to the Excel file and use it in the script below:

```{=html}

```
The [monstR](https://github.com/HFAnalyticsLab/monstR) and [onsr](https://kvasilopoulos.github.io/onsr/) R packages provide access to the ONS beta API. However, the API currently has a limited number of datasets, and in particular it lacks access to the data for smaller geographies that we're typically interested in e.g. wards and LSOAs.

## LSOApop R package

> The goal of LSOApop is to make population estimates for Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) and their Indecies of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) easily available in R.
