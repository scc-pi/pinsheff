# Version control & GitHub {#github}

You don't have to be familiar with version control, Git and GitHub to make use of these notes or the contents of the [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) repositories. If you're [new to scripting and R](#getting-started-with-r), then visualisations or using R Markdown are better starting points than version control.

These notes are public, but to contribute i.e. [edit them](https://github.com/scc-pi/notes), you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and to be granted permission by an owner of [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) (try Laurie first, but Giles and Anne could help too). Then you can edit directly in GitHub via your browser.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/github-edit.png")
```

You also need a GitHub account and permission to access one of our private repositories, but not for our public repositories, to download a file, copy & paste code, or source and use a function:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# # Load functions from a public scc-pi repository 
# source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scc-pi/functions/main/Examples.R")
# 
# # Call one of our Sheffield area functions that returns LSOA codes 
# shef_lsoa_codes() %>% 
#   head(5) %>% #only display the first 5 records
#   knitr::kable() #display them in a nice table 
```

Try raising an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) if you spot a problem, have a suggestion or a question.

## Why version control?

When scripting you might make a backup copy of a file, so if your new changes break what was previously working you can revert to the backup copy. If you're collating contributions to a document from different people you might use their initials in the file names to indicate and keep track of who's made contributions in what version e.g. "BI_Principles-GR.docx" and "BI_Principles-NM.docx". These are both examples of manual version control.

When we talk about version control and scripting we typically mean a version control system. A tool that assists with tracking changes to files over time and by different people. Such systems also usually include reasons for the changes, and file, or rather version, comparison functionality. So a version control system is a backup/audit trail/collaboration thing.

This is a much more engaging explanation:

## GIT

Git is an open-source distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## GitHub

GitHub is a product that offers Git-based source control repositories. Other products also offer Git-based repositories, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps.

Our [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) GitHub organisation is a free account. It has had no approval as such. If using it proves successful we will need to discuss approval with BCIS.

### GitHub security & data protection {#github-security}

GitHub.com is hosted in the US, which is an issue in terms of our data protection obligations. Plus, we've not checked compliance with Information Governance, so storing PID (Person Identifiable Data), or anything commercially confidential or politically sensitive, on GitHub.com is currently a no-no.

The [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file lists the folders and files you want to exclude from the repository i.e. it specifies what you want to ignore. Holding any file based data (e.g. CSV files), whether they're original or transformed, in a `/data` sub-folder, makes it simple to exclude data from the repository by adding the following to the `.gitignore` file:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# data directory
/data/
```

As an additional precaution, any projects involving confidential information should be held in a private repository and [`.Rdata`](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/rdata-files.html) should also be included in the `.gitignore` file (see the section on [RStudio security & data protection](#pid)):

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Session Data files
.RData
```

Microsoft own GitHub and [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/github.githubenterprise?tab=overview) is the on-premises deployment of GitHub.com that could be hosted on our own Azure environment. However, BitBucket currently looks like a more likely solution than GitHub.  

### BitBucket  

BitBucket is Council approved and used by Digital Services, the only team in the Council that uses version control for code. BitBucket has an EU hosting option and is cheaper than GitHub. It is more popular with organisations needing private repositories (our main use case), whereas GitHub is more popular with open source projects. Fundamentally, the two have very similar functionality. One difference is the narrower scope of BitBucket, which instead chooses to focus on stronger integration with other software, in particular other Atlassian products such as Trello, Jira and Confluence.

If the current BI Team GitHub trial comes to the conclusion that version control is something we need, we have to have a conversation with Information Governance and TDA about BitBucket. We also need to keep in touch with Digital Services who may switch to an alternative version control provider in July 2022. I need to verify my expectation that using BitBucket with RStudio is the same experience as using GitHub. 

### Forking & pull requests

GitHub [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and pull requests are common workflows when collaborating on a repository.

*TODO - we'll have more to add on this once we've collaborated on a repository*

### Other features

GitHub now allows private repositories on [free organisation accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts), but not all GitHub features are available.

The evolution of a repository is captured by commits i.e. the changes to files in the repository. However, the original issue, ideas or discussion surrounding a commit is captured in a GitHub [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can link a commit to an issue by including the issue number prefixed by `#` in the commit message.

I've used a GitHub [project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) to organise our private [C19Surveillance](https://github.com/scc-pi/C19Surveillance) repository as a kanban board. However, a project is not restricted to issues or a single repository.

GitHub [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) have been used to [publish these notes](#publishing).

There are also other GitHub features to explore.

## Git & RStudio

[Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) and the GitHub [Learning Lab](https://github.com/apps/github-learning-lab) are good places to get started and become familiar with some initial concepts.

To use GitHub with RStudio there's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/git-github.pdf) and a thorough step-by-step guide, [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan. 

Over the last few years we've followed Jenny's recommendations:  

* Initially to use HTTPS.  
* Then to use SSH whilst GitHub was introducing their PAT requirement.  
* Now back to HTTPS, but with PAT. 

Our recommendation is to follow the following chapters in Happy Git with R:  

* [9 Personal access token for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)  
* [11 Connect to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)  
* [12 Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)  

Chapters 15, 16 and 17 of Happy Git with R cover different ways of setting up a local RStudio project connected to GitHub. So far, we've stuck with [Chapter 15 New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html).  

To change an existing local repo from SSH to HTTPS:  

* Make sure all your repo changes are committed and pushed to GitHub.  
* Rename the local repo folder.  
* Create the local RStudio project anew, but this time using the HTTPS url for the GitHub repo.  

If you know a better way than this please let us know!  

When out of the office and connected via AlwaysOn VPN, both the HTTPS and SSH connection methods should work. However, the SSH will never work when in the office because the Council's proxy doesn't support SSH. It works when out of the office because when connected via AlwaysOn VPN not all traffic is routed via the Council and it's proxy.  

*TODO:* Test and liase with James Grande about proxy https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html and .pac file. This issue is related to accessing APIs and install R packages when in the office.
